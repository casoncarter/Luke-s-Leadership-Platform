<p>THE SPORTS LEADERSHIP PLATFORM</p>
<p>Lessons from Coach K, Distance Runners, and Legendary Athletes</p>
<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
<p>Sport is one of the greatest classrooms of leadership. It demands discipline, resilience, communication, humility, and courage under pressure. More than any scoreboard, the true test of an athlete is how they prepare, how they respond, how they treat others, and how they carry themselves when adversity hits.</p>
<p>Few leaders embody these lessons better than Coach Mike Krzyzewski (“Coach K”), whose values-based approach turned teams into families and talent into collective greatness. Alongside him, distance runners—from Eliud Kipchoge to Joan Benoit Samuelson—teach some of the purest leadership lessons in the world: consistency, self-mastery, mental toughness, and purpose-driven pursuit.</p>
<p>And then there are leaders closer to home—like Meredith Valmon (Rainey), two-time Olympian and Harvard All-American, who now coaches and mentors young athletes with humility, strength, and wisdom. Her presence in this platform gives Luke a real, living example of elite leadership he sees every week.</p>
<p>This platform distills the universal truths of sports leadership into ten modules designed to help you understand how champions think, train, connect, and lead—and how you can apply these lessons in sports, school, friendship, and life.</p>
