<h2 id="the-guitar-training-platform">THE GUITAR TRAINING PLATFORM</h2><p>Play What You Hear. Understand What You Play. Learn Fast. Have Fun.</p><p>Executive Summary</p><p>Learning guitar as a pianist isn’t starting over — it’s unlocking music from a new angle. If piano is architecture, guitar is geometry: shapes, patterns, and repeating structures that turn harmony into something physical and immediate. Because Luke already understands chords, keys, progressions, and ear-based learning, he can learn guitar much faster than the average beginner.</p><p>This platform teaches guitar the way musicians actually use it:</p><p>Shape-based (CAGED) rather than notation-based</p><p>Ear-first, not theory-first</p><p>Song-driven, not exercise-driven</p><p>Play-focused, not practice-heavy</p><p>By mastering a few core concepts — chord shapes, transitions, strumming, fretboard patterns, and song structure — Luke can quickly gain fluency and freedom on the instrument.</p><p>This is the path not only to playing the guitar, but to enjoying it.</p><h2 id="module-1-the-guitar-mindset-play-by-shape-not-by-note">Module 1: The Guitar Mindset — Play by Shape, Not by Note</h2><p>Core Principle: Piano thinks vertically; guitar thinks geometrically.</p><p>On piano, chords stack.
On guitar, chords shape.</p><p>What to Learn</p><p>Chords are built as hand shapes, not individual notes.</p><p>These shapes repeat up the neck (unlike the piano).</p><p>Patterns make everything easier — especially for someone who already knows harmony.</p><p>Starter Exercise</p><p>Pick a chord you know (G, C, D, Am).
Slide it up the neck while keeping the shape.
Hear how it becomes new chords instantly.</p><p>Key Resources</p><p>CAGED overview (Paul Davids): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p0yhiJdPRY</p><p>JustinGuitar “Beginner Mindset” lessons: https://www.justinguitar.com/categories/beginner-guitar-lessons-grade-1</p><h2 id="module-2-the-caged-system-your-new-map-of-the-guitar">Module 2: The CAGED System — Your New Map of the Guitar</h2><p>Core Principle: Five shapes = every chord, everywhere.</p><p>If Luke learns these five shapes, he unlocks the entire fretboard:</p><p>C shape</p><p>A shape</p><p>G shape</p><p>E shape</p><p>D shape</p><p>Every major chord, every barre chord, every voicing… all come from these.</p><p>Why This Is Perfect for a Pianist</p><p>CAGED is the guitar’s “logic.”
Once you see it, you can play the instrument instead of chasing it.</p><p>Key Resources</p><p>CAGED Deep Dive (Sean Daniel): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bqVdF4VQWc</p><p>JustinGuitar CAGED Essentials (free course): https://www.justinguitar.com/modules/caged-system</p><h2 id="module-3-chord-families-the-guitarists-harmonic-shortcuts">Module 3: Chord Families — The Guitarist’s Harmonic Shortcuts</h2><p>Core Principle: Most songs use three chord families.</p><p>Luke already understands functional harmony. These three families will feel natural:</p><p>The Big Three:</p><p>G Family: G – C – D – Em</p><p>C Family: C – F – G – Am</p><p>D Family: D – G – A – Bm</p><p>Learn these, and he can play thousands of acoustic songs instantly.</p><p>Try This</p><p>Choose a song he knows on piano in G major.
Play it on guitar using only G-family shapes.

It’s the right hand.</p><p>Learn These First:</p><p>Down, down-up, up-down-up (the universal pattern)</p><p>16th-note feel (for pop)</p><p>Shuffle feel (for folk &amp; blues)</p><p>Exercise</p><p>Mute the strings with your left hand.
